A Pure Development Theme for WordPress

‘Base‘ is a starter theme for WordPress developed by @benbuildsstuff from Dijitul. The theme has no html mark up at all. Each template includes just the basic WordPress functionality and hooks to start a new WordPress website with. Page templates, post templates, multi blog layouts, categories and archives, plus a custom post type layout is include. There is no css apart from a basic css reset. Everything you need to get started building a WordPress website.

No Html, No CSS, No Javascript

There’s no markup in ‘Base’. We don’t impose ids, classes or external libraries on you as a developer. You can build your site as you want to. If you want to use html5 that’s cool. Go ahead. Base simply gives you the WordPress hooks and tags needed for a standard WordPress site.

We let your front-end skills shine.
